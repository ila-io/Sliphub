# Sliphub
A USB hub that I can slip on and off of the top of my Surface Pro! 

It has 2 USB A ports and 2 USB C ports, and will fit on the top of my surface pro alongisde my [slipboard](https://github.com/ila-io/slipboard/)! I modeled this after the design I made for that, and am hoping it's the second of a suite of slip-on accessories for my laptop :D


I made it because the surface pro only has 2 USB C ports, which is basically unusable for any considerable amount of wired devices (i.e. using it in place of a desktop with monitors, input devices, etc), and I didn't have a USB hub already! 

heres what the product looks like!
