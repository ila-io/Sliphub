# July 23rd 
today i did some researach on USB hubs... initially i planned on having 2 USB A, 1 USB C, and 1 HDMI, but i learned that it was probably wise to avoid HDMI due to the complications that arise from implementation, so now its just another USB C port making for 1 of each type!



additionally i created my schematic :3

after that i made my case in fusion too! its supposed to mimic the look of my [slipboard](https://github.com/ila-io/slipboard/tree/main) hackpad, since im trying to build out a cohesive ecosystem of accesories for my surface pro!

got my PCB in today and picked up the bottom half of the case from my friend, but he didnt print the top half, and he moves out for college tomorrow so i cant get him to print it :sob: 
i can get it printed out pretty soon hopefully though!

it took me like 5 minutes to slip it in and secure it, but it works perfectly!
