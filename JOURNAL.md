# July 23rd 
today i did some researach on USB hubs... initially i planned on having 2 USB A, 1 USB C, and 1 HDMI, but i learned that it was probably wise to avoid HDMI due to the complications that arise from implementation, so now its just another USB C port making for 1 of each type!



additionally i created my schematic :3
